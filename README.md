# Flex-Yoga

## Overview

This repository demonstrates a basic website for the business logic of yoga classes. The readme file shows the work flow of the website. 
This website solves the problem of the registeration and subscription of yoga classes. It allows the user to sign up and register for the yoga classes. The user can see their dashboard. On the dashboard, the user can see their subscription status and can pay to buy another month's subscription. The user can select their batch which can be edited in the next month.
User can also avail the login feature and revisit the website to check their subscription status and pay the fees to renew their subscription. 

Heroku doesn't provide free services anymore. So I couldn't use heroku to make the server live. Please follow the instructions below to run the project.

## Work flow

- The user visits the website and sign up for the yoga classes.
- Once the user registration is completed, the user can access their dashboard.
- To complete the registration process and join the yoga classes the user is required to complete the payment.
- User can pay the fees every month from their dashboard.
- User can also change their batch from their dashboard.
